# All the properties have default values, and you don't need to set anything.
# This file lists properties according to how likely you will need to want to change them.
# You may want to look at Spring Beans configuration. It's a 'flavor' of your application.

# This file is structured as follows:
# First, a comment describes the property and what it is for. It is followed by all the possible values (in case it is a limited set) with explanation.
# Finally, the default value is given, if there is one. If there is no default or it is unimportant, the line is commented out.

## dxa.properties file contains main application properties. Modules properties are separated in other files.
## Check documentation and included Configuration_Quick_Reference file for details.

### ===================================================================================================================
### Used Spring beans, different flavors of some services, etc.
### ===================================================================================================================

# Two properties that define a set of enabled Spring profiles:

# spring.profiles.active property is defined once per all the configuration files; if defined in many places, then the latest is taken.
# Can be used as a main set of profiles.

# spring.profiles.include properties are merged from all the configuration files. Can be used to selectively turn on/off some of the profiles.
# Some of the values are found in modules properties.

# Multi-line configuration is also possible:
#spring.profiles.active=search.solr, \
#  51degrees.context.provider, \
#  dxa.no-cache

spring.profiles.active=
spring.profiles.include=

# adf.context.provider - Activates ADF instead of Context Service for context claims.
#spring.profiles.include=adf.context.provider
# 51degrees.context.provider - Activates 51 Degrees as a context provider; requires dxa-51degrees-module where it is also enabled in properties.
#spring.profiles.include=51degrees.context.provider

# dynamic.navigation.provider - Activates Dynamic Navigation keyword-based navigation provider instead of SiteMap-based static one.
#spring.profiles.include=dynamic.navigation.provider

# dxa.no-cache - Disables DXA cache completely; doesn't affect CIL cache.
#spring.profiles.include=dxa.no-cache

# auto.dd4t.ms.provider - Automatically configures DD4T MS provider. Only needed if you do use this provider. By default, you don't.
#spring.profiles.include=auto.dd4t.ms.provider

### ===================================================================================================================
### DXA cache management
### ===================================================================================================================

# DXA tries to use CIL cache if possible. It is possible if CIL uses GeneralCacheProvider, then all the settings are compatible with DXA cache.
# If not, then DXA uses the following configuration file instead:
#dxa.caching.configuration=ehcache.xml

# If you want to disable a specific DXA cache and leave others, you can add its name to this property separated by comma.
# Values: [defaultCache (nonspecific usage), pages, entities, sitemaps, model-service (requests to MS), failures (exceptions), output (HTML output)]
#dxa.caching.disabled.caches=

# Caches are created lazily, when needed. But some of the caches are needed from the very beginning.
# This causes startup to be a bit slower, but it makes the very first request a bit faster. You will probably be happy with default value.
# If cache is configured in ehcache.xml file, then it's also created, no matter what is configured in this property.
# Values: [defaultCache (not specific usage), pages, entities, sitemaps, model-service (requests to MS), failures (exceptions), output (HTML output)]
dxa.caching.required.caches=defaultCache, failures

### ===================================================================================================================
### Model Service client configuration
### ===================================================================================================================

# By default DXA gets the URL of Model Service through Discovery Service. If you are not happy with this for any reason,
# you can specify the URL to your Model Service, which will be used instead.
#dxa.model.service.url=http://localhost:8998/

# Model Service doesn't have its own CIS capability and registers as a part of Content Service. This property sets a key name for the URL in extension properties of CS.
#dxa.model.service.key=dxa-model-service

# These four properties set a default mapping of MS REST endpoints. Unless you really know what you're doing, don't change them.
#dxa.model.service.url.entity.model=/EntityModel/{uriType}/{localizationId}/{componentId}-{templateId}
#dxa.model.service.url.page.model=/PageModel/{uriType}/{localizationId}/{pageUrl}?includes={pageInclusion}
#dxa.model.service.url.api.navigation=/api/navigation/{localizationId}
#dxa.model.service.url.api.navigation.subtree=/api/navigation/{localizationId}/subtree/{siteMapId}?includeAncestors={includeAncestors}&descendantLevels={descendantLevels}
