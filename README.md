About
-----
The SDL Digital Experience Accelerator (DXA) is a reference implementation of SDL Tridion Sites 9 and SDL Web 8 intended to help you create, design and publish an SDL Tridion/Web-based website quickly.

DXA is available for both .NET and Java web applications. Its modular architecture consists of a framework and example web application, which includes all core SDL Tridion/Web functionality as well as separate Modules for additional, optional functionality.

This repository contains the source code of the DXA Framework, an example Java web application, and a Maven archetype for Java. 

The full DXA distribution (including Content Manager-side items and installation support) is downloadable from the [SDL AppStore](https://appstore.sdl.com/list/?search=dxa) 
or the [Releases in GitHub](https://github.com/sdl/dxa-web-application-java/releases)
Furthermore, the compiled DXA artifacts are available on [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cdxa). 

To facilitate upgrades, we strongly recommend that you use official, compiled DXA artifacts from Maven Central instead of a custom build.
If you really must modify the DXA framework, we kindly request you to submit your changes as a Contribution (see the Branches and Contributions section below).

Branches and Contributions
--------------------------
We are using the following branching strategy:

 - `master` - Represents the latest stable version. This may be a pre-release version (tagged as `DXA x.y Sprint z`). Updated each development Sprint (approximately bi-weekly).
 - `develop` - Represents the latest development version. Updated very frequently (typically nightly).
 - `release/x.y` - Represents the x.y Release. If hotfixes are applicable, they will be applied to the appropriate release branch so that the branch actually represents the initial release plus hotfixes.

All releases (including pre-releases and hotfix releases) are tagged. 

Note that development sources (on `develop` branch) have dependencies on SNAPSHOT versions of the DXA artifacts, which are available here: https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/sdl/dxa/

If you wish to submit a Pull Request, it should normally be submitted on the `develop` branch so that it can be incorporated in the upcoming release.

Fixes for severe/urgent issues (that qualify as hotfixes) should be submitted as Pull Requests on the appropriate release branch.

Always submit an Issue for the problem, and indicate whether you think it qualifies as a hotfix. Pull Requests on release branches will only be accepted after agreement on the severity of the issue.
Furthermore, Pull Requests on release branches are expected to be extensively tested by the submitter.

Of course, it is also possible (and appreciated) to report an issue without associated Pull Requests.


DXA Builder
-----------
The current DXA Builder is available in Maven Central, and the latest DXA Builder is also available as a public snapshot.

If you have not configured a snapshot repository and don't want to, you may need to install the DXA Builder locally in order to run the SNAPSHOT. 

To install it, run the wrapper script of the `dxa-builder` project: `gradlew(.bat) publishLocal` 
On Windows, you can also just run `get-started.cmd` script at first run.


DD4T support
---
DD4T 2.1 for Java is incorporated into the DXA codebase in the `dxa-compatible` artifact. As a result, when migrating from DD4T to DXA, you do not need separate dependencies on DD4T.


Snapshots
---------
DXA publishes SNAPSHOT versions to Sonatype. To use them, configure `https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots` as a repository in your Maven settings. Read [this](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html#Repositories) for instructions.
